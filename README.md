# password-strenth-detection-system
This project implements an intelligent password strength detection system using Python that evaluates password entropy, identifies weak patterns, checks for breached and reused passwords, and provides actionable security recommendations. The solution is developed and tested using Google Colab and related Google tools.

This repository contains both a Python script (.py) for direct execution
and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for demonstration and testing.
